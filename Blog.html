            <p>The evolution of web design has been a fascinating journey, transforming from simple, static pages to dynamic, interactive experiences that we rely on daily. In the early days of the internet, websites were basic and text-heavy, often lacking visual appeal and functionality. However, with the advancement of technologies like HTML, CSS, and C# web design began to evolve, introducing better layouts, animations, and user-friendly interfaces. The rise of responsive design further revolutionized web development, ensuring that websites look and function seamlessly across all devices, from desktops to smartphones. Today, web design continues to push the boundaries with innovations in UX/UI design, progressive web apps, and AI-driven interactions, offering more personalized and immersive experiences for users.</p>

            <p>
                When it comes to learning how to code, many people are intimidated by the idea, assuming it’s a difficult and complex skill to master. But the truth is, coding isn’t inherently hard—it just requires patience, persistence, and the right approach. Like learning any new skill, coding takes time to understand, and everyone starts as a beginner. While there are challenges along the way, the key is to break coding down into smaller, manageable steps, focusing on one concept at a time. With the abundance of online resources, coding tutorials, and communities offering support, it’s easier than ever to get started, making coding accessible to anyone with the willingness to learn.</p>

            <h2>Adamson University Stuck in the Top 5 or Ready to Break and rise to the Big 4</h2>
            <img src="Adu 5.jpg" alt="JavaScript Frameworks">
            <p>For years, Adamson University has firmly established itself as one of the top contenders in the Philippines' higher education scene, consistently ranking in the top 5 among universities. But the question on many minds is whether Adamson has what it takes to rise above its current position and crack into the prestigious Big 4—the elite group of universities that dominate the nation’s academic and athletic landscapes. With a strong emphasis on academic excellence, innovative programs, and a growing presence in collegiate sports, Adamson has shown signs of readiness to challenge the status quo. However, the journey to joining the Big 4 isn’t an easy one, and the university will need to continue investing in its infrastructure, faculty, and research to elevate its national standing. As competition heats up, all eyes are on Adamson to see if it will continue to rise and carve out a bigger role in the country’s top-tier universities.</p>
